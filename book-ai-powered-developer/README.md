### Part 1. The foundation

LLMs are deep learning models that are good at providing natural language responses to natural language prompts. 

If you are interested in diving deeper into the theory behind LLMs, neural networks, and all things generative AI, you should look at the following two books: the forthcoming Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch) by Sebastian Raschka (Manning, 2024) and the amusingly titled The Complete Obsolete Guide to Generative AI by David Clinton (Manning, 2024).

Most LLMs use the Transformer architecture, a deep learning model that relies on self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence regardless of their position. This allows LLMs to generate more contextually relevant text. A typical Transformer model consists of an encoder and a decoder, each composed of multiple layers.

This is known as the **Refinement Pattern** in prompt engineering: iteratively refining or improving the prompt to get more accurate, relevant, or sophisticated responses.

The second part of the prompt introduces a prompting pattern we will see throughout this book: **the Persona Pattern.** In the context of prompt engineering, mainly related to AI and LLMs, the Persona Pattern refers to a strategy of designing prompts that establish a specific persona or role for the AI to assume. This approach guides the model’s responses consistently and contextually appropriately. One of the key benefits of using the Persona Pattern is maintaining consistency in responses. Adhering to a defined persona makes the AI’s replies more predictable and aligned with the user’s expectations. In this case, we have asked ChatGPT to assume the persona of an intern with a background in computer science. Why an intern? We want a persona who will do the work.

Comparing ChatGPT, Copilot, and CodeWhisperer: The first dimension we will consider is the engagement model: how we engage with AI.

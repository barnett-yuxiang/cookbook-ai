### I: Introduction to Large Language Models

Mechanisms such as attention, transfer learning, and scaling up neural networks, which provide the scaffolding for Transformers, were seeing breakthroughs right around the same time.

The original Transformer architecture, as devised in 2017, was a **sequence-to-sequence model**, which means it had two main components:
- An encoder, which is tasked with taking in raw text, splitting it up into its core components (more on this later), converting those components into vectors (similar to the Word2vec process), and using attention to understand the context of the text
- A decoder, which excels at generating text by using a modified type of attention to predict the next best token

[]

The original Transformer has two main components: an encoder, which is great at understanding text, and a decoder, which is great at generating text. Putting them together makes the entire model a “sequence-to-sequence” model.

How an LLM is **pre-trained** and **fine-tuned** makes all the difference between an okay-performing model and a state-of-the-art, highly accurate LLM. 

##### Pre-training

Every LLM is trained on different corpora and on different tasks.

BERT was originally pre-trained on English Wikipedia and the BookCorpus. More modern LLMs are trained on datasets thousands of times larger.

Some LLMs are trained on proprietary data sources, including OpenAI’s GPT family of models, to give their parent companies an edge over their competitors.

##### Transfer Learning

Transfer learning is a technique used in machine learning to leverage the knowledge gained from one task to improve performance on another related task. 

##### Fine-Tuning

##### Attention

Attention is a mechanism used in deep learning models (not just Transformers) that assigns different weights to different parts of the input, allowing the model to prioritize and emphasize the most important information while performing tasks like translation or summarization. 

Modern LLMs that rely on attention can dynamically focus on different parts of input sequences, allowing them to weigh the importance of each part in making predictions.

##### Embeddings

Embeddings are the mathematical representations of words, phrases, or tokens in a large-dimensional space.

LLMs learn different embeddings for tokens based on their pre-training and can further update these embeddings during fine-tuning.

##### Tokenization

breaking text down into the smallest unit of understanding—tokens. 

#### Beyond Language Modeling: Alignment + RLHF

#### Popular Modern LLMs

BERT: is an autoencoding model that uses attention to build a bidirectional representation of a sentence.

GPT-3 and ChatGPT: contrast to BERT, is an autoregressive model that uses attention to predict the next token in a sequence based on the previous tokens.

T5: is a pure encoder/decoder Transformer model that was designed to perform several NLP tasks, from text classification to text summarization and generation, right off the shelf. 

#### Classical NLP Tasks

1. Text Classification
2. Translation Tasks
3. SQL Generation
4. Free-Text Generation

>I will not often use the term “generative AI,” as the word “generative” has its own meaning in machine learning as the analogous way of learning to a “discriminative” model.

Batch Prompting

Prompt Chaining: Task decompositino - LLM selection - Prompt engineering - Integratino

##### Chaining as a Defense Against Prompt Injection

##### Chaining to Prevent Prompt Stuffing

The problem demonstrated here: When we ask too much of an LLM, it often simply starts to select which tasks to solve and ignores the others.

![](./assets/Figure-5_10.png)

Figure 5.10 Our multimodal prompt chain—starting with a user in the top left submitting an image—uses four LLMs (three open-source models and Cohere) to take in an image, caption it, categorize it, generate follow-up questions, and answer them with a given confidence.

##### Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Chain-of-thought prompting is a method that forces LLMs to reason through a series of steps, resulting in more structured, transparent, and precise outputs. The goal is to break down complex tasks into smaller, interconnected subtasks, allowing the LLM to address each subtask in a step-by-step manner. This not only helps the model to “focus” on specific aspects of the problem, but also encourages it to generate intermediate outputs, making it easier to identify and debug potential issues along the way.

Another significant advantage of chain-of-thought prompting is the improved interpretability and transparency of the LLM-generated response. By offering insights into the model’s reasoning process, we, as users, can better understand and qualify how the final output was derived, which promotes trust in the model’s decision-making abilities.

##### Example: Grade-School Arithmetic with LLMs

our goal in this example is to enhance an LLM’s ability to understand, reason, and solve relatively intricate math word problems.

For this example, we will use an open-source dataset called GSM8K (Grade School Math 8K), a dataset of 8500 linguistically diverse, grade-school math word problems. 

An example of the GSM8K dataset shows a question and a chain of thought that walks through how to solve the problem step by step, resulting in the final answer after a delimiter “####”. Note we are using the main subset; a subset of this dataset called socratic has the same format but its chain of thought follows the Socratic method.

Note how the GSM8K dataset includes << >> markers for equations, just as ChatGPT and GPT-4 do. This is because those LLMs were in part trained using similar datasets with similar notation.

```python
def format_k_shot_gsm(examples, cot=True):
    if cot:
        
        return '\n###\n'.join(
            [f'Question: {e["question"]}\nReasoning: {e["answer"].split("####")[0].strip()}\nAnswer: {e["answer"].split("#### ")[-1]}' for e in examples]
        )
    else:
        return '\n###\n'.join(
            [f'Question: {e["question"]}\nAnswer: {e["answer"].split("#### ")[-1]}' for e in examples]
        )
```

Three examples seems to be the sweet spot for OpenAI. 
We can see that, in general, there does seem to be an optimal number of examples for our LLMs. Three seems to be a great number for working with OpenAI models, but more work could be done on Cohere to improve performance.

##### Testing and Iterative Prompt Development

Advanced prompting techniques can enhance the capabilities of LLMs; they are both challenging and rewarding. We saw how dynamic few-shot learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and multimodal LLMs can broaden the scope of tasks that we want to tackle effectively. We also dug into how implementing security measures, such as using an NLI model like BART-MNLI as an off-the-shelf output validator or using chaining to prevent injection attacks, can help address the responsible use of LLMs.

Happy Prompting!

#### Case Study: Reinforcement Learning from Feedback

General, defining what constitutes “good” output text can be challenging, as it is often subjective and task/context-dependent. 

When we fine-tune LLMs, we must design a loss function to guide training. But designing a loss function that captures these more subjective attributes can seem intractable, and most language models continue to be trained using a simple next-token prediction loss (autoregressive language modeling), such as cross-entropy. As for output evaluation, some metrics were designed to better capture human preferences, such as BLEU or ROUGE; however, these metrics still have limitations, as they compare generated text to reference texts using very simple rules and heuristics. We could use an embedding similarity to compare outputs to ground truth sequences, but this approach considers only semantic information, which isn’t always the only thing we need to compare. We might want to consider the style of the text, for example.

But what if we could use live feedback (human or automated) for evaluating generated text as a performance measure or even as a loss function to optimize the model? That’s where reinforcement learning from feedback (RLF)—RLHF for human feedback and RLAIF for AI feedback—comes into play. By employing reinforcement learning methods, RLF can directly optimize a language model using real-time feedback, allowing models trained on a general corpus of text data to align more closely with nuanced human values.

ChatGPT is one of the first notable applications of RLHF. While OpenAI provides an impressive explanation of RLHF, it doesn’t cover everything, so I’ll fill in the gaps.

The training process basically breaks down into three core steps:
1. Pre-training a language model: Pre-training a language model involves training the model on a large corpus of text data, such as articles, books, and websites, or even a curated dataset. During this phase, the model learns to generate text for general corpora or in service of a task. This process helps the model to learn grammar, syntax, and some level of semantics from the text data. The objective function used during pre-training is typically the cross-entropy loss, which measures the difference between the predicted token probabilities and the true token probabilities. Pre-training allows the model to acquire a foundational understanding of the language, which can later be fine-tuned for specific tasks.
2. Defining (potentially training) a reward model: After pre-training the language model, the next step is to define a reward model that can be used to evaluate the quality of the generated text. This involves gathering human feedback, such as rankings or scores for different text samples, which can be used to create a dataset of human preferences. The reward model aims to capture these preferences, and can be trained as a supervised learning problem, where the goal is to learn a function that maps generated text to a reward signal (a scalar value) representing the quality of the text according to human feedback. The reward model serves as a proxy for human evaluation and is used during the reinforcement learning phase to guide the fine-tuning process.
3. Fine-tuning the LM with reinforcement learning: With a pre-trained language model and a reward model in place, the final step is to fine-tune the language model using reinforcement learning techniques. In this phase, the model generates text, receives feedback from the reward model, and updates its parameters based on the reward signal. The objective is to optimize the language model such that the generated text aligns closely with human preferences. Popular reinforcement learning algorithms used in this context include Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). Fine-tuning with reinforcement learning allows the model to adapt to specific tasks and generate text that better reflects human values and preferences.

##### Sinan‘s Attempt at Wise Yet Engaging Responses: SAWYER

The plan to make SAWYER a reality has three steps:
1. make GPT-2 understand the concept of answering a question
2. define a reward model that rates human-preferred responses to questions highly, and
3. set up a reinforcement learning loop to nudge GPT-2 to give human-preferred responses.

let’s roll up our sleeves and get to work!:
Step 1: Supervised Instruction Fine-Tuning
Step 2: Reward Model Training // Defining a Custom Loss Function
Step 3: Reinforcement Learning from (Estimated) Human Feedback

In general, given our tasks, custom losses, and custom RLF loops, it seems that SAWYER may be ready to answer some questions, so let’s give it some to try it out.

##### The Ever-Changing World of Fine-Tuning

For example, one fascinating technique that’s captured the attention of LLM engineers in recent years is **PEFT** **LoRA**.
1. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) greatly shrinks the number of adjustable parameters within an LLM by freezing the majority of pre-trained weights in place and adding only a few additional weights on the side.
2. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) further slims down the supplemental weights from PEFT by decomposing them into compact, lower-rank matrices.

The combined strength of PEFT and LoRA offers an impressive reduction in training time and memory requirements, allowing for more flexible and optimal LLM fine-tuning without sacrificing much (if any) performance.

Summary: Our focus on fine-tuning BERT for classification highlighted that even simple tasks can be greatly optimized with techniques such as `freezing`, `gradient accumulation`, and `semantic downsampling`. Careful balancing of these elements can lead to improved performance. The depth of control and customization available when we fine-tune these models are vast and permit us to adapt them to a wide array of tasks and domains.

### 9 Moving LLMs into Production

Quantization is a technique used to reduce the precision of the weights and biases in a neural network. It results in a smaller model size and faster inference time, with a modest decrease in model accuracy. Different types of quantization are possible, including dynamic quantization (where weights are quantized at runtime), static quantization (which also includes input/output value scaling), and quantization-aware training, where the quantization error is considered during the training phase itself.

Pruning is another technique that helps reduce the size of an LLM. It involves removing those weights in the neural network that contribute the least to the model’s output, thereby reducing the complexity of the model. This results in faster inference times and a smaller memory footprint, making it particularly useful for deploying models in resource-constrained environments.

### B. LLM  Glossary

#### Transformer Architecture

The foundational structure for modern LLMs, the Transformer architecture introduced in 2017 was a sequence-to-sequence model comprising two main components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder is responsible for processing raw text, splitting it into core components, converting these into vectors, and using attention to grasp the context. The decoder excels at generating text by predicting the next best token using a modified attention mechanism. Despite their complexity, Transformers and their variants, such as BERT and GPT, have revolutionized the understanding and generation of text in natural language processing (NLP).

#### Attention Mechanism

Introduced in the original Transformer paper, “Attention Is All You Need,” attention allows LLMs to focus dynamically on various parts of an input sequence, determining the importance of each part in making predictions. Unlike earlier neural networks, which processed all inputs equally, attention-powered LLMs have revolutionized prediction accuracy.

The attention mechanism is mainly responsible for enabling LLMs to learn or recognize internal world models and human-identifiable rules. Some research indicates that LLMs can learn a set of rules for synthetic tasks like playing the game of Othello, simply by training them on historical move data. This has opened up new avenues for exploring what other kinds of “rules” LLMs can learn through pre-training and fine-tuning.

#### Large Language Model (LLM)

LLMs are advanced natural language processing (NLP) deep learning models. They specialize in both processing contextual language at scale and predicting the likelihood of a sequence of tokens in a specific language. The smallest units of semantic meaning, tokens can be words or sub-words and act as the key inputs for an LLM. LLMs can be categorized as autoregressive, autoencoding, or a combination of both. Their defining feature is their substantial size, which enables them to execute complex language tasks like text generation and classification, with high precision and potentially minimal fine-tuning.

#### Autoregressive Language Models
Autoregressive language models predict the next token in a sentence based solely on the prior tokens in the sequence. They correspond to the decoder part of the Transformer model and are typically applied in text generation tasks. An example of such a model is GPT.

#### Autoencoding Language Models

Autoencoding language models are designed to reconstruct the original sentence from a corrupted version of the input, making them the encoder part of the Transformer model. With access to the complete input without any mask, they can generate bidirectional representations of entire sentences. Autoencoding models can be fine-tuned for various tasks, from text generation to sentence or token classification. BERT is a representative example.

#### Transfer Learning

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique in which knowledge gained from one task is utilized to enhance performance on another related task. In LLMs, transfer learning implies fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM for specific tasks, such as text classification or text generation, using smaller amounts of task-specific data. This makes the training process more time-and resource-efficient.

#### Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering focuses on designing effective prompts—that is, inputs to LLMs—that clearly convey the task to the LLM, resulting in accurate and beneficial outputs. It’s a craft that demands an understanding of language subtleties, the particular domain in question, and the capabilities and constraints of the LLM in use.

#### Alignment

The concept of alignment deals with the degree to which a language model can comprehend and react to prompts in a manner consistent with user expectations. Traditional language models, which predict the next word or sequence based on the preceding context, don’t allow for specific instructions or prompts, limiting their application scope. Some models do incorporate advanced alignment features, such as AI’s RLAIF and OpenAI’s RLHF, improving their prompt response capacity and usefulness in applications like question-answering and language translation.

#### Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

RLHF is an alignment technique used in machine learning that involves training an AI model based on feedback from human overseers. The human provides rewards or penalties to the model based on its responses, effectively guiding its learning process. The aim is to refine the model’s behavior so that its responses align more closely with human expectations and needs.

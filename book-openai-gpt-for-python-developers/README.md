There is no single answer to this question. It depends on your use case and the type of application you are building. In general, you should use the most recent model available. For example, from a functionality perspective, if you are building a chatbot, you should use the GPT-3.5-Turbo-Instruct model. If you are building an application that generates images from text, you should use the DALL-E 3 model. If your application requires more capabilities, you should use the GPT-4 model.

InstructGPT models tend to be less prone to chatter and more task-oriented, making them ideal for accomplishing what is asked of them. This can save time and token usage, especially when the task is straightforward and the context is clear.

**Base GPT-3 Series**
1. Ada (A): Suitable for basic tasks, typically the quickest and most cost-effective in the GPT-3 lineup.
2. Ada (A): Suitable for basic tasks, typically the quickest and most cost-effective in the GPT-3 lineup.
3. Curie (C): Highly efficient, offering faster performance at a cost lower than Davinci.
4. Curie (C): Highly efficient, offering faster performance at a cost lower than Davinci.

The base **GPT-3 models** are capable of understanding and generating human language and text that appears to be natural language. They are also capable of performing a large number of tasks, including:
- Text classification
- Semantic search
- Text summarization
- Sentiment analysis
- Content generation
- Text completion
- Text translation
- Text extraction

**Codex Series**

The Codex series was announced in mid-2021. It is a descendant of GPT-3 that has also been trained on code from 54 million GitHub repositories and powers the code autocompletion tool, GitHub Copilot.

Codex has two models:
1. code-davinci-002
2. code-cushman-001

Codex was deprecated in March 2023 and replaced by GPT-3.5-Turbo. This table is maintained for historical purposes.

##### DALL-E Series
The DALL-E series is a family of models that can generate images from text descriptions. It is the successor to the ImageGPT series and is inspired by the GPT-3 series. The DALL-E series has two models: Dall-E-2 and DALL-E-3.

##### TTS Series

In addition to the Chat Completion and image generation models, OpenAI also offers a text-to-speech (TTS) model series. There are two models in this series: TTS-1 and TTS-1-HD.

##### Whisper Model

Whisper is an open-source speech recognition model that can convert spoken language into written text. This model has been trained on 680K hours of multilingual data and supports the following languages

##### Embedding Model

The embedding model is a model that can be used to embed text into a vector space. This operation is often used in machine learning and deep learning applications. The best model to use for this task is the text-embedding-ada-002 model, which is more accurate than all the other models.

> Tokens, by definition, are common sequences of characters in the output text. A good way to remember this is that one token usually equates to about 4 letters of text for standard English words. This means that 100 tokens are approximately equivalent to 75 words.
